## Space Constellation Analytics

This project explores satellite constellations and space-object patterns using simple data analysis and visual mapping. The goal is to make it easy to understand how satellites are distributed, how they move, and what trends or insights can be pulled from publicly available datasets.

### What’s inside

- data/ raw or cleaned datasets used for analysis

- notebooks/ Jupyter notebooks with the analysis steps

- outputs/maps/ generated visualizations and constellation maps

### How to use

Clone the repo

Open any notebook in the notebooks folder
